Java codes for Challenge questions



Good job in completing the challenges!!! Hopefully, it helped you to learn and enhance your skills. Please find below my review comments.

1. Please append class names with what the function is actually doing.
2. Good Job on formatting date time before printing.
3. Challenge10 - when exception is thrown, it would be useful to at least print out ex.Message along with the custom error message. This could help debugging the problem without actually running the program
4. Please ensure pascal case for all methods Eg - StringPermutation. Also, any method should be a verb, method name can be either permuteString or performPermutation, etc
5. DuplicateCharacter program - avoid using too many c, I, j as variable names. Every time I need to figure out what each of it stands for. Ex c is counter we can call it so.
6. Challenge3 - Please do not hardcode inputs
7. No acronyms/abbreviations in variable, method or class names. Ex FileOutputStream fout, makes the code unreadable.
